**Summary**: in this tutorial, we will introduce you to a PostgreSQL sample database that you can use for learning and practicing PostgreSQL.

We will use the DVD rental database to demonstrate the features of PostgreSQL.

## Download the PostgreSQL sample database

You can download the PostgreSQL DVD Rental sample database via the following link:

[Download DVD Rental Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)

The database file is in `zip`format ( `dvdrental.zip`) so you need to extract it to `dvdrental.tar` [before loading the sample database into the PostgreSQL database server](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/load-postgresql-sample-database/).

## Download printable ER diagram

Besides the sample database, we provide you with a printable ER diagram in PDF format. You can download and print the ER diagram for reference while practicing PostgreSQL.
